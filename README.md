# Render Todo List - Level 1

This beginner-friendly project teaches you how to render lists of tasks to the DOM using JavaScript. It's designed for students who are just getting comfortable with arrays, objects, and the `.forEach()` method.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that includes a `<ul>` element to display todo items.
- **`levelOne.js`**: Renders a simple array of strings (task names) as list items.
- **`levelTwo.js`**: Renders an array of task objects, but only shows tasks that are marked as done.
- **`review.js`**: A practice file that reviews rendering all tasks, and then selectively rendering only completed tasks with their index numbers.

## Key Concepts

- Accessing and manipulating the DOM with `document.getElementById` and `appendChild`
- Using `.forEach()` to loop through arrays
- Conditionally rendering list items
- Working with objects inside arrays
- Displaying index numbers with `${index + 1}`
